    germansokolov13 commented on Apr 30, 2015 I need an element be repeated as with v-repeat but not for each array element but rather N times where N is some Vue's property of type number. I don't know how to do it with custom directives or components. Maybe
    it would be useful to create some sort of a v-times predefined directive? Or maybe I am missing something? @yyx990803 Member yyx990803 commented on Apr 30, 2015 You can just do v-repeat="10", or it can also be bound to a numeric value: http://vuejs.org/guide/list.html#Iterating_Over_a_Range
